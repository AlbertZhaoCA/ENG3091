PsyClub Mandala Healing Activity

Last weekend, we painted our inner mandalas together and experienced a unique journey of mental healing. Each piece was unique, just like the story of each participant's soul.

**Color and Harmony**

Amid the intertwining colors, we explored ourselves, released emotions, and found inner peace. The symmetrical mandala patterns became the focus of our meditation, guiding us into a state of deep relaxation.

**Meditation and Self-Discovery**

In a quiet atmosphere, we put aside the hustle and bustle of daily life, engaged in a deep inner journey through drawing, and had a meaningful self-dialogue.

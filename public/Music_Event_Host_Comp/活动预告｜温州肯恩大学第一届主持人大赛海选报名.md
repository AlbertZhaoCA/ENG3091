## Overview

**"The passion in front of the microphone never fades."**

In this beautiful autumn season of knowledge harvest, Wenzhou-Kean University's Student Party Building Studio, WKU Art Troupe, and Campus Radio Station jointly present WKU's First Host Competition, bringing a talented and meaningful hosting event.

This competition aims to further promote the Party's values, discover and develop campus hosting talents, and serve as a comprehensive event for talent display, skill enhancement, cultural exchange, and public participation. Through the unique on-the-spot performances of the hosts, we hope to convey the responsibilities of the young generation and promote positive energy to guide society. At the same time, by providing this platform for cultural exchange and public engagement, we strengthen the connection between the Party and the people and inspire love for the Party and country among students, striving for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

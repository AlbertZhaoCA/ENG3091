          <strong>"The passion in front of the microphone never fades."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this beautiful autumn season of knowledge harvest, Wenzhou-Kean
          University's Student Party Building Studio, WKU Art Troupe, and Campus
          Radio Station jointly present WKU's First Host Competition, bringing a
          talented and meaningful hosting event.
        </p>
        <p>
          This competition aims to further promote the Party's values, discover
          and develop campus hosting talents, and serve as a comprehensive event
          for talent display, skill enhancement, cultural exchange, and public
          participation. Through the unique on-the-spot performances of the
          hosts, we hope to convey the responsibilities of the young generation
          and promote positive energy to guide society. At the same time, by
          providing this platform for cultural exchange and public engagement,
          we strengthen the connection between the Party and the people and
          inspire love for the Party and country among students, striving for
          the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

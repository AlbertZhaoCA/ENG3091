Golden Autumn

October Festive Season

At a certain moment in life, time paused for a second. The monotonous symphony of falling leaves can also be defined by romance. In this season when golden light covers everything, college life becomes more worth anticipating and enjoying.

In the long journey of life,  
all kinds of emotions piece together a vast landscape in our small world,  
enriching our lives,  
and broadening our horizons.

When facing an uncertain and challenging future, or reminiscing about the past full of obsession and letting go, have you ever had unspoken feelings?

In response, PsyClub is launching the  
**"Worries Grocery Store"**  
activity.

This is an event prepared for everyone's inner monologue and desire to share,  
aiming to provide an opportunity for anonymous or selective real-name communication,  
allowing students to share their experiences, broaden their social circle, meet more interesting people, and understand more about the journey of others. Together with PsyClub, why fear a distant future?

This activity is rich in content, mainly including

**Emotion Mailbox, Q&A Sticky Notes, MBTI Friendship**

Participants can write their thoughts or experiences on letter paper or sticky notes, choosing to remain anonymous or use their real names as they prefer. Contact information can be written at the bottom of the letter or sticky note, and they can also leave their MBTI attributes for better understanding among participants. Questions raised will be answered and advised upon by other experienced students, achieving the goal of mutual help.

**There are also small gifts for participating in the activity**, carefully selected for both beauty and practicality, with multiple options to choose from, so don't miss out~

This activity is a two-way gift of emotional value, an interaction between different individuals.

Let's open our hearts through communication, better understand the world, and always be moved by moments in life, maintaining a positive attitude towards life.

Standing in the wilderness, any direction is forward.

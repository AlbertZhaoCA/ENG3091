The strings of the orchestra sway gently, seemingly dancing with the spring breeze; the ancient instruments of the traditional Chinese music ensemble interpret the soul of Chinese music, immersing you in long-lasting melodies; the choir's voices are like heavenly music, presenting you with a symphony for the soul. Additionally, there will be a special vocal ensemble that will bring you unexpected surprises.

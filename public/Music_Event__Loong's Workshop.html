        <p>WKU Art Troupe 2024-05-21 20:53</p>
        <p>Art is a bridge connecting different cultures, ideas, and emotions. It transcends language barriers, allowing us to find resonance deep in our hearts. In this dragon-themed event, we held a series of workshops to allow participants to experience this ancient and magical theme firsthand.</p>
        <p>From <strong>handmade lanterns</strong> to <strong>paper cutting</strong>, from <strong>calligraphy</strong> to <strong>tea art</strong> and <strong>vocal music</strong>, each one was a unique artistic experience, letting us explore the legend of the dragon and feel the charm of art.</p>

            </div>
            <p>For the "Dragon Light Dragon Dragon" Calligraphy Appreciation workshop, we invited <strong>Mr. Shen Qian</strong> to hold a Chinese calligraphy appreciation event for our students and Chinese and foreign faculty and staff.</p>
            <p>The event specially incorporated the cultural theme of the Year of the Dragon. By using the symbolic meaning of luck, authority, and nobility, the workshop allowed students and faculty to experience the charm and profound heritage of traditional culture through the art of calligraphy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shen shared his calligraphy experience and gave a lecture on Chinese character culture, exploring the evolution of the character "龙" (dragon) and the stories behind the new year buzzwords: "麘麘," "朴朴," "䲜䲜," and "燚燚." Teachers and students jointly traced the character "龙" and experienced the printmaking of new dragon-themed words.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The life of literati in the Song Dynasty included four arts: tea ceremony, incense burning, flower arrangement, and hanging paintings.</p>
            <p>Among them, the first is the tea ceremony. The action of whisking and striking is intricate yet romantic, with a good outcome described as, "Green clouds are blown continuously by the wind, and white flowers float, condensing on the surface of the bowl." Patterns could be painted on well-whisked tea, which could be appreciated as art or simply enjoyed as a drink.</p>
            <p>In this tea art workshop, under the guidance of <strong>Ms. Chen Xiaoqian</strong>, students and teachers learned about the culture of the tea ceremony and its historical origins. They learned the steps and techniques of the tea ceremony and completed their own tea creations, experiencing the elegance of the Song Dynasty.</p>

In the cozy and energetic atmosphere of a party house, we participated in various interactive games and team-building activities, quickly bringing everyone closer together. Laughter filled the venue as attendees enjoyed delicious food and drinks while strengthening teamwork and camaraderie through challenges and games.  

This successful event not only fostered connections among members but also infused new vitality into the association. Through such activities, we believe the Science Association will continue to thrive in scientific research and academic exchanges.  

We thank everyone who supported and joined the event, and we look forward to meeting more science enthusiasts in future activities to drive academic progress and innovation together!`,
